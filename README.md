## üì¶ Included Software Packages
This repository contains configuration files for the following software:

- **Hyprland** - A dynamic tiling Wayland compositor  
- **Waybar** - A highly customizable status bar  
- **Kitty** - A fast GPU-based terminal emulator  
- **Neovim** - A powerful, extensible text editor

### üöÄ Features
Hyprland WM configuration for tiling and dynamic workspace management

Waybar customization for an aesthetic and informative status bar

Alacritty/Kitty terminal settings optimized for performance

### üìÇ Installation
You can quickly replicate this setup on any system using GNU Stow.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyprland-dotfiles.git
cd hyprland-dotfiles
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Install GNU Stow

Make sure GNU Stow is installed:

``` bash
sudo pacman -S stow  # Arch-based systems
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy Dotfiles with Stow
Run the following command to symlink the configurations:

```bash
stow -v -t ~/.config hyprland waybar rofi nvim kitty
